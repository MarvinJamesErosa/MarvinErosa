# Message Button


## Project Description

Message Button is a basic Windows Forms application featuring a button that, when pressed, displays my name. This project marks my inaugural assignment in my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class, serving as an introduction to both Git/GitHub version control and C# programming language.

Please note that there is no executable file included. To run this project, it must be opened and executed within Visual Studio with .NET desktop development installed.

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:	

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/marvinjameserosa/ambiance.git  
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```
    cd \message-button
    ```
2. Install Visual Studio *(Note: Include in the installation the .NET desktop development)*:

    ```
    https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
    ```
3. Run the app
